🚀 CPU Scheduling Simulator

*A simple and interactive CPU Scheduling simulator built using *Streamlit

📌 Overview

This project is a real-time CPU Scheduling Simulator that helps visualize various CPU scheduling algorithms. Users can input processes, select a scheduling algorithm, and view a Gantt chart and performance metrics such as average waiting time and turnaround time.

✨ Features

✅ Supports FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling algorithms✅ Real-time Gantt Chart Visualization 📊✅ Performance Metrics Calculation (Waiting Time, Turnaround Time)✅ User-friendly UI using Streamlit✅ Multi-page design for better usability✅ Simple and interactive interface
